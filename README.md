# ms_office_word_simple_version_control
This is a general macro snippet which run on a preset ms office environment. 

I have forgot the usage since this project was out of maintainance for couple years, later I think I can recall it and update this readme file. 
this is simple than excel version and very useful to backup dr you word document. there is not ppt version till now. may be I need some resource to make it out.
